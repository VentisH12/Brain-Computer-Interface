# Optimizing sensor locations for non invasive brain computer interfaces (BCIs) using geometric algorithms

As a Clark Research Intern, I worked on a challenge to develop a computational method to determine the optimal sensor placement for identifying the neural ensembles electrical signals are relayed from. 

Consider a workspace W consisting of an open half plane bounded by a line L. Workspace W represents the brain, whereas L denotes the surface of the skull and the set of viable locations for sensor placement. Neural ensembles are represented by a set of points P = {p1 , p2 , …} within W . Our goal is to determine a set S = {s1 , s2 , …} of points (sensor locations) on L such that any subset of P can be uniquely identified based on the sum of the reciprocals of their distances to S.
